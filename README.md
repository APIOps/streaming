# Streaming from APIOps events

APIOps events streaming is handled with youtube at least for the beginning. In this setup we use iPad. You need: 
- Live Now app
- access to APIOps youtube (get username and password from Meetup organizers)

## Live Now app
Live Now app is free and can be downloaded from appstore. In the app you need to configure broadcast key, which can be found from Youtube settings https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard 
- live streaming and you'll find the encoder setup below the videoscreen. 
- Server URL: rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2
- Stream name/key: xxxxxxxxxxxxx (you'll need this). 

The server url should be there in the app already, but you need to insert the stream name/key. After that when you press record, the stream will appear at below given address and is automatically stored to youtube. 

## Youtube live 
Address for live broadcast is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1pBHMSm5-gWjkLswIwt6WA/live
