APIOps events streaming is handled with youtube at least for the beginning. In this setup we use iPad. You need:

## Live Now app
Live Now app is free and can be downloaded from appstore. In the app you need to configure broadcast key, which can be found from Youtube settings https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard 
- In youtube dashboard select "live streaming" and you'll find the encoder setup below the videoscreen. There is Stream name/key. 
- In Live Now App configuration: Server URL: rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2
- In Live Now App configuration: name/key: xxxxxxxxxxxxx (from Youtube dashboard, Stream name/key).

The server url should be there in the app already, but you need to insert the stream name/key. After that when you press record, the stream will appear at below given address and is automatically stored to youtube. You dont need to be logged in to Youtube to stream. Stream name/key is used to identify your device. 

## Youtube live 
Address for live broadcast is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1pBHMSm5-gWjkLswIwt6WA/live
